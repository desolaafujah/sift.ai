In large repos, cross-functional team members (PMs, designers, QA, analysts, new devs) often:
- Struggle to understand what a repo does
- Waste time trying to understand what a repo does
- Need to ask engineers over and over
- Even devs themselves get lost in codebases they didn't write (or haven't touched in months)


Solution:
An AI tool that:
- Scans a repo, understands structure, function purposes, maybe even usage flows
- Generates summaries of each file/function/module
- Answers questions like: "Where is the payment logic?" or "What happens after a user clicks this button?"
- Future feature: provide diagrams or natural language guides for the non-technical folks
